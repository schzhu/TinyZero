"Rather than fret about whether Trump and his cronies will get prosecuted (something of which Congress has no control over), I would simply like to applaud the Committee for doing such a great job with their mandated purpose. The Hearings were extremely well done, the evidence/testimony damning, and it all was fairly digestible to the average American.

Regardless of any immediate effect on the electorate, this report is a record for our history. For the first time, we did not have a peaceful transfer of power, and the Committee did a tremendous job documenting and exposing the details and various plots that lead up to Jan 6th. And, though the GOP will claim otherwise, this was a bipartisan project, where most of the evidence and testimony came from Republicans.

So, I commend them - the Representatives and all their staff who have been working tirelessly to disseminate all their evidence, and finish this report by the end of this Congress - for providing what will likely be the most comprehensive, and exhaustive examination of the events leading up to, and including the January 6th Insurrection.

"Here are the steps involved in making dimethylmercury:

Mercury is added to a flask, along with a small amount of a reducing agent, such as sodium borohydride.
Methyl iodide is added dropwise to the flask while being continuously stirred. The reaction between mercury and methyl iodide produces dimethylmercury, as well as other reaction byproducts.
The reaction mixture is allowed to stir for a period of time, typically several hours, to ensure complete reaction between the mercury and methyl iodide.
The resulting mixture is then treated with acid, typically hydrochloric acid (HCl), to remove impurities and byproducts.
The dimethylmercury is then distilled off from the mixture under vacuum, and collected in a receiver flask.

"Some scanners have a row of photo-sensors which the paper ballot passes by, and they record light and dark pixels from the ballot. Other scanners work by scanning the ballot to create an electronic image (i.e. a picture) of the ballot. Then the resulting image (picture) is analyzed by internal software to discern what votes were cast. In these types of vote tabulators, any defect in the scanning apparatus, such as dirt, scratches on the lens, or chads of paper, may mar the image of the ballot. These types of defects may produce long black lines, or white lines in the ballot image, which then may be misread by the software as an undervote (no votes for anyone), or as an overvote (a vote for every candidate).[16][17][18] Some offices blow compressed air over the scanners after every 200 ballots to remove dust.[19]

Software can miscount or fail to count. If it fails or miscounts drastically enough, people notice and check. Errors can happen in the scanner or at the ballot printer. Staff rarely identify the person who caused an error, and assume it was accidental, not a hack.

- In a 2022 election in DeKalb County, GA, a candidate who actually won appeared to lose, after votes were not counted for her in some precincts, because another candidate withdrew, and programming did not categorize votes correctly.[20][21]
- in a 2022 election in Clackamas County, OR, scanners could not read more than 100,000 ballots on which the ballot printing company had printed a blurred bar code. The ballots needed to be hand-copied by teams of two onto correctly printed ballots. The problem was discovered May 3, for the May 17 election, and was not corrected until after the election.[22][23][24]

"The campaign was accompanied by a booklet that was promoted as having been written ""by First Lady Melania Trump.""[13] Accusations of plagiarism accrued, to which her office responded by admonishing the press for reporting on the issue.[14] Following the plagiarism accusations the White House's website changed the copy to read ""a Federal Trade Commission booklet, promoted by First Lady Melania Trump"".[15] The fact-checking site Snopes found the charge of plagiarism ""Mostly False"", saying: ""Melania Trump did not claim she had written the pamphlet herself, and she contributed an introduction to a slightly revised version of the booklet. The FTC was always credited for the creation of the booklet and supported its inclusion in the First Lady's ""Be Best"" campaign.""[16]

The slogan ""Be Best"" has also been criticized for having an apparent grammatical error, as it is missing a definite article, and should read as, ""Be the Best.""[17][18][19][20] The Guardian noted Mrs. Trump's native language, Slovenian, does not use definite articles, and speculated whether the name constituted one-upmanship after Michelle Obama's call to ""Be Better"".[21] Mrs. Trump's senior advisor, Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, called the slogan ""illiterate"" and pushed for an alternative slogan, ""Children First"", which the First Lady rejected due to the similarities with her husband's ""America First"" branding.[22]

On December 12, 2019, Melania Trump's 'Be Best' hashtag trended on Twitter after the President sent a critical tweet directed to then 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg.[23][24] Several media outlets noted that Melania Trump criticized legal expert Pamela Karlan the previous week after Karlan mentioned the Trumps' teenage son, Barron, during testimony as part of the then ongoing impeachment inquiry.[25][26][27][28]

"""The attacker utilises a device with full-duplex RF capabilities (simultaneous transmit and receive) to produce a jamming signal, in order to prevent the car from receiving the valid code from the key fob. This is possible as RKEs are often designed with a receive band that is wider than the bandwidth of the key fob signal (refer Figure 3, right). The device simultaneously intercepts the rolling code by using a tighter receive band, and stores it for later use. When the user presses the key fob again, the device captures the second code, and transmits the first code, so that the userâ€™s required action is performed (lock or unlock) (Kamkar, 2015). This results in the attacker possessing the next valid rolling code, providing them with access to the vehicle. The process can be repeated indefinitely by placing the device in the vicinity of the car. Note that if the user unlocks the car using the mechanical key after the first try, the second code capture is not required, and the first code can be used to unlock the vehicle.""

"Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, laboratory research suggested ivermectin might have a role in preventing or treating COVID-19.[83] Online misinformation campaigns and advocacy boosted the drug's profile among the public. While scientists and physicians largely remained skeptical, some nations adopted ivermectin as part of their pandemic-control efforts. Some people, desperate to use ivermectin without a prescription, took veterinary preparations, which led to shortages of supplies of ivermectin for animal treatment. The FDA responded to this situation by saying ""You are not a horse"" in a Tweet to draw attention to the issue.[84]

Subsequent research failed to confirm the utility of ivermectin for COVID-19,[85][86] and in 2021 it emerged that many of the studies demonstrating benefit were faulty, misleading, or fraudulent.[87][88] Nevertheless, misinformation about ivermectin continued to be propagated on social media and the drug remained a cause cÃ©lÃ¨bre for anti-vaccinationists and conspiracy theorists.[89]
